# SD_Assignment

If you need some dummy data you can use *stack_overflow.sql* file to import the database in MySQL Workbench.

The file can be found on the main/resources. Also, in the same folder you will find an export of a Postman collection with a suite of operation (add, create, delete, get) used for testing.

The application will start on the port 8080. After starting this application, you can start the UI for the application. 
This can be found in the *SD_Assignment_UI* repository on github.
